                        <p class="paragraph">Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers
                            the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must
                            keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself,
                            which gets harder as the snake lengthens. It originated in the 1976
                            two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where
                            the goal is to survive longer than the other player. The concept
                            evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer
                            with each piece of food eaten often apples or eggs. The simplicity
                            and low technical requirements of snake games have resulted in
                            hundreds of versions some of which have the word snake or worm
                            in the title for many platforms.
                            1982's Tron arcade game, based on the film,
                            includes snake gameplay for the single-player
                            Light Cycle segment, and some later snake games
                            borrow the theme. After a version simply called
                            Snake was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998,
                            there was a resurgence of interest in snake games. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">My implementation is made on a website, so it is broadly available. I used
                            ThreeJS library, because
                            it allows me
                            to draw simple 3D shapes. Snake board on my website is 11x11 and you start with 3 body
                            parts.
                            You
                            can move using WSAD
                            keys or arrow keys, but when you play on mobile device you can swipe to change directions.
                            Whole
                            implementation and
                            game is simple, as it is made for my studies.
